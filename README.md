# Simple Counter Application

This project is a simple counter application created using HTML, JavaScript, and a basic DOM manipulation approach. The page features the following functionality:

1. **Display Counter**: The counter value is displayed on the webpage in an `<h1>` tag, which starts at `0` by default.
2. **Increment Button**: The "+" button allows the user to increase the counter by one every time it is clicked.
3. **Decrement Button**: The "-" button decreases the counter by one, with a restriction that prevents the value from going below zero. If the user attempts to decrease the counter further, an alert appears, notifying them that the lowest possible value is 0.
4. **Reset Button**: The "Reset" button resets the counter back to 0, allowing the user to start over.

The functionality is powered by JavaScript, which manipulates the counter value and updates the display dynamically. The project uses basic HTML and JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM elements, and functions to control the behavior of the counter.
